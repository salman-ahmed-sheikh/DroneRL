# DroneRL
In this project we applied both Reinforcement learning techniques:
1. Model based learning
2. State space based learning

to fly the multiple Drones in controlled envoirment

We had a custom envoirment for this problem to validate our movement

This envoirnment support upto 5 Drones at a time.
